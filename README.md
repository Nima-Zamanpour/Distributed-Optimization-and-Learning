# Distributed-Optimization-and-Learning

This repository contains 3 projects for the Distributed Optimization & Learning course. The algorithms are implemented without using any solver.

## Contents

The repository is organized into 3 folders for each topic:

- [Decentralized](Decentralized/): Decentralized optimization of multiple UAV formation control using dual, ADMM, and proximal ADMM methods
- [Distributed](Distributed/): Distributed consensus optimization of multiple UAV formation control with obstacle avoidance
- [MARL](MARL/): Implementing various single and multi-agent algorithms in PettingZoo's Multiwalker
